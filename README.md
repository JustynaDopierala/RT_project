### RT_project
**Step 1:** generate directory structure

**Step 2:** Download TCGA data (manually) and place in the "data/TCGA_data/" dir

**Step 3:** Download the "fasta.fa" file and place in the "data/fa_input/" directory

**Step 4:** Generate TCGA matrix with full set of genes (~60,000) 
>--> run the "1_prepare_full_TCGA_matrix.sh" (provide path to the project directory as command line argument)
>--> results will be generated under "analysis/TCGA_matrix_full/"

**Step 5:** Inspect the library file 
>--> run "2_inspect_fa_select_TCGA.py" (provide path to the project directory as command line argument)
>--> results will be generated under "analysis/3_input_library_inspect" (look at library composition, get a list of unique genes, look for duplicate sequences, get the number of guides per gene)

**Step 6:** Generate TCGA matrix selecting for genes that are present in the "library.fa" file 
>--> this will be generated by running the "2_inspect_fa_select_TCGA.py" script
>--> results will be generated under "analysis/2_TCGA_matrix_selected/"
